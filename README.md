Welcome to my personal collection of cybersecurity projects!  
This repo contains small-to-mid-scale tools and scripts I’m building to learn and apply core cybersecurity concepts using Python.

Whether it’s password strength checking, network scanning, or breach detection — each project here is designed to help me grow as a cybersecurity student and future security professional.
